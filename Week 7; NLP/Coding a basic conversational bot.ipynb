    "A conversational bot, like Eliza, is a program that elicits user input and seems to understand and respond intelligently. Unlike Eliza, our bot will not have several rules giving it the appearance of having an intelligent conversation. Instead, our bot will have one ability only, to keep the conversation going with random responses that might work in almost any trivial conversation.\n",
